# The SYP Commandments

1. Never pull without a plan.
2. Always plan for worst case scenario.
3. Waifu/Husbando > Meta, but every character also deserves to be balanced and worth your investment.
4. Your mental and financial well-being is more important than a game.
5. "Building pity" is a myth invented by the paper-handed. Never pull unless you're okay getting the rate-up 5âœ°.
