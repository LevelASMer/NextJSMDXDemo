# Rules

- Because of the sheer volume of questions we receive, **not all questions will be answered.**
- "Ask A Question" is for text only (no links). "Submit Media" is for links, photos, etc.
- No personal questions. (Asking for opinions is OK.)
- No leak compilation videos.
- Only answers we believe to be of general interest will be cross-posted to our Twitter/Discord.
- **For theorycrafting**, please refer to the [KQM network](https://keqingmains.com/network), [the Genshin Impact Helper Team's Character Builds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNxZ2xab1J6o1TuNVWMeLOZ7TPOqrsf3SshP5DLvKzI/edit#gid=2001372201), and the [Leaked Theorycrafting channels of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor](https://discord.gg/HuTao).
- **For future characters / reruns**, please visit our Upcoming Characters page, which is kept up-to-date with all of the information we currently have.
- **For character-pulling advice**, please note that the more details you include about the state of your account / what exactly you're struggling to decide, the more likely we are to respond.
- **"Will I have enough saved by (patch)?"** questions will no longer be answered. [Here are the resources we use to crunch the numbers and help plan ahead.](https://saveyourprimos.tumblr.com/resources) If you have specific questions about using these resources, let us know.
