Our purpose is to provide information about upcoming character releases to help Travelers plan ahead, due to how difficult and expensive pull currency is to save and obtain.

We avoid spoilers as best we can. We also do not report character kit changes between Beta updates.

We are proud to have been the first group dedicated to aggregating and tracking the reliability of banner-related leaks in a single, easy-to-reference place. Since we started, we have built and continue to maintain [a robust Archive on Discord](https://discord.gg/SaveYourPrimos) that tracks reliable leaks across EN, CN, and RUS sources.

The SYP Team consists of two admins [(A.Q. and I.T.)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896293417573810209/989718026276454461/FV61XVCUsAEW41P.jpg) and a small, wonderful team of volunteer translators we'd be nowhere without.

Should we have reliable intel to share, we now leak character-related information at [SpendYourPrimos](https://twitter.com/SpendYourPrimos).

The best we can provide is what trusted sources currently believe to be true. Every aspect is subject to change, every source is subject to being incorrect.

As our KoFi got (rightfully) shut down due to violating their ToS for referencing copyrighted material, we currently have no form of monetization.
