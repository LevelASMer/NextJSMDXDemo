# Estimated Freemogem Income / Min. # of Free Pulls Per Patch: ~65+ Limited Pulls Per Patch

Using conservative averages from the [Freemogem History] documentation above. Assumes full exploration, full participation in In-Game Events + Web Events, full completion of new content (Achivements, Serenitea Pot, etc.), and full-clears of Spiral Abyss per patch.

Spiral Abyss accounts for ~11 pulls per patch, or ~2.75 pulls per full-cleared floor per patch. If you do not participate in Spiral Abyss, subtract 11 pulls from the final Pulls Per Patch number that applies to you.

### + Welkin (~26 Pulls) = ~91 Limited Pulls Per Patch

90 (daily Welkin primos) + 10 (300 Genesis Crystal Welkin bonus converted to average # of extra primos per day of Welkin) x 42 (days in a patch) = 4,200

4,200 รท 160 (primos per limited pull) = 26.25

### + Battle Pass (~8 Pulls) = ~99 Limited Pulls Per Patch

4 (Intertwined Fates from rewards) + 4 (converting level 50 reward of 680 primos to Intertwined Fates) = 8

# 1 x Guaranteed Limited Character = ~160 pulls / ~25,600 primos

- Assuming lost 50/50 + forced to hit soft pity both rounds.
- Hard pity is at 90, soft pity is at 75; calculated at conservative estimate of 80. (80 x 2 = 160)

# 1 x Guaranteed Specific Limited Weapon = ~210 pulls / ~33,600 primos

- Assuming a lost 75/25, then a lost 50/50, to max out Fate Points for Epitomized Path + forced to hit soft pity all three rounds.
- Hard pity is at 80, soft pity is at 65; calculated at conservative estimate of 70. (70 x 3 = 210)
